# Analytics Implementation Guide

## Overview

The Tech Maven Geospatial marketing website includes comprehensive analytics tracking designed for defense and government sector requirements, with privacy and security considerations built-in.

## Google Analytics 4 Setup

### 1. Configuration

1. **Get your GA4 Measurement ID** from Google Analytics
2. **Add to environment variables**:
   ```bash
   # In .env.local
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
   ```

3. **Privacy-First Configuration**:
   - IP anonymization enabled
   - Secure cookie flags
   - GDPR compliance ready
   - Only loads in production

### 2. Tracked Events

#### Core User Actions
- **Page Views**: Automatic tracking
- **Contact Form Submissions**: With clearance level context
- **Demo Requests**: Different types (hero, features, etc.)
- **Resource Downloads**: Document type tracking
- **Security Briefing Requests**: High-priority lead indicator

#### Defense/Government Specific Tracking
- **Clearance Level Interest**: Track by clearance requirements
- **Solution Category Interest**: GEOINT, C2, FMV, etc.
- **Compliance Page Views**: Section 508, NIST, etc.
- **Government Contact Method Usage**: Phone vs. email vs. secure channels

### 3. Event Categories

```javascript
// Contact & Lead Generation
trackContactFormSubmit(formType, clearanceLevel?)
trackDemoRequest(demoType)
trackSecurityBriefingRequest()

// Resource Engagement
trackResourceDownload(resourceType, resourceName)
trackSolutionInterest(solutionType)

// Compliance & Security
trackCompliancePageView(complianceType)
```

## Privacy & Security Compliance

### Government Requirements
- **IP Anonymization**: Enabled by default
- **Secure Cookies**: SameSite=Strict, Secure flags
- **No PII Collection**: Clearance levels tracked as categories only
- **Export Control Compliance**: No technical specifications tracked

### GDPR/Privacy Compliance
- **Consent Management**: Ready for cookie consent integration
- **Data Minimization**: Only business-relevant events tracked
- **Retention Controls**: Standard GA4 retention policies apply

### Security Considerations
- **No Classified Info**: Only unclassified business metrics
- **Secure Transmission**: HTTPS only
- **Access Controls**: GA4 account should have appropriate access restrictions

## Alternative Analytics Options

### For High-Security Environments

1. **Government-Approved Analytics**:
   - Replace GA4 with FedRAMP-approved solutions
   - Adobe Analytics Government
   - On-premise analytics solutions

2. **Self-Hosted Options**:
   - Matomo (Privacy-focused)
   - Plausible Analytics
   - Custom analytics solution

3. **Implementation**:
   ```javascript
   // In Analytics.tsx, modify the tracking functions:
   const trackEvent = (action, category, label?, value?) => {
     // Replace with government-approved service
     // Example: MatomoTracker.trackEvent(category, action, label, value);
   };
   ```

## Metrics Dashboard Setup

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1. **Lead Generation**:
   - Contact form completion rate
   - Security briefing requests
   - Demo requests by source

2. **Engagement Quality**:
   - Time on site by user type
   - Resource download patterns
   - Solution interest distribution

3. **Government-Specific Metrics**:
   - Clearance level distribution of visitors
   - Compliance page engagement
   - Government domain visitor patterns

### Custom Dimensions Setup
Configure these custom dimensions in GA4:
1. **User Type**: Government, Defense Contractor, Systems Integrator
2. **Clearance Level**: Public, Confidential, Secret, Top Secret
3. **Solution Interest**: C2, GEOINT, FMV, Climate, 3D Viz
4. **Organization Type**: Military, Intelligence, Federal, State, Local
